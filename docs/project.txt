PURPOSE

Access 'utility/helper - files' from within neovim.

Quickly switch to a local or global todo file, README.md, .gitignore or whatever files
are designated as 'helpers'.

Recursion goes beyond the $CWD that the nvim session was started in; Perhaps you
only want a single todo file for all of your projects, but want to avoid
constant `cd` this `..` that.

HOW IT WORKS

Designate your own helper-files. Run the command or key bind and let the plugin
recursively search up and down the tree, as deep as `$HOME` or limited, all
settable in the configuration on a per directory basis.

Also designate a global 'helper directory' - accessible from any nvim
session accessible from any nvim session.
